## Presentation

Topic: Classification of NYC Public Schools 

We selected this topic because we felt it was important for the community to be able to identify how the schools are classified in relation to one another so that they can make informed personal decisions. In addition, districts would also be able to use this model to identify the characteristics which make for a high-quality school versus a low-quality school and make decisions based on the predictions.
