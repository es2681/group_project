# Student Analysis Project

## Presentation

### Topic: Classification of NYC Public Schools 
Can a machine learning model adequately categorize whether an NYC public school is considered "good" with publicly available data? For this project, we are looking to answer this question. We selected this topic because we felt it was important for the community to be able to identify how the schools are classified in relation to one another so that they can make informed personal decisions for their children. In addition, districts would also be able to use this model to identify the characteristics which make for a high-quality school versus a low-quality school and make decisions based on the predictions. 

We will use publicly available NYC schools data, including the percentages of students with disabilities, students living in poverty, and students who pass the regents exams, as well as the distribution of various ethnicities and gender at each school, to categorize schools by their 4-year high school graduation rates as a "good" school or not.

### Description of source data:
- This data comes from the [New York City Department of Education Website](https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/graduation-results).

- The file includes all of the data for each public school in NYC from cohorts 2003 to 2017. 

- In addition to categorizing students by graduation year, the data also includes information for students who graduated within the standard 4 years as well as statistics for students who needed more than 4 years to graduate. 

- The features that will be included in the modeling of the data are Category, Cohort Year, # Total Cohort, Cohort, %Grads, %Total Regents of Cohort, %Advanced Regents of Cohort, %Regents without Advanced of Cohort, %Dropout, SWD (Students with Disabilities), Ethnicity, Gender, Poverty.

### Questions to be answered:
- In what ways can NYC Public Schools be classified? By what features are similar schools classified? 

- How will classifying NYC Public Schools help parents decide where to live or where to send their children? 

- How can classifying NYC Public Schools help districts identify which schools need more help?

### Database Management

## Segement 1:

Below you will see two images that show a skeleton of our database along with Entity Relationship Database. 


- Database: 

![](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/School_Analysis_Database.png)

    - all_data: contains all the data
    - ethnicity: breaks down the data base on ethnicity
    - gender: breaks down the data base on gender
    - poverty: breaks down the data base on income disadvantages
    - swd: breaks down the data baseds on students with disabilities or not


- ERD:

![](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/School_Analysis_ERD.png)

    - Has all 5 tables
    - Shows that DBN is the primary key
    - shows all the tables are connected to all_data based on DBN
    - has columns we are considering using

## Segment 2:

Now that the data has been added to the database, PS_School_Analysis, we have to clean it, so that it can show the data we want. Some tables were easy to clean/alter and join via SQL, except for the following tables:

- Ethnicity table
- Poverty table
- SWD (student with disabilities)

If we were to use SQL to clean/alter data, we would have duplicate results, making it complex to clean. As an alternative, we decided to do a data clean up via Pandas. Before loading our dataset, we used SQL to create a skeleton of how our table will look once we used a JOIN statement. Later, tables above were first loaded onto our Jupyter notebook and then we indicated which columns we wanted to keep. We then removed all DBN, School_Name, and Cohort_Year duplicates. The results we wanted populated and then saved under â€œtransformed_XXX_table.

Our Ethnicity table was by far a more complexed table to clean and set up through SQL. The only way to get our table into our database was to connect our database with pandas via SQLAlchemy. Once SQLAlchemy was running, we imported our cleaned ethnicities data and created a table in our database (see image in images folder)

    

## Machine Learning Model
We want to determine which school are the better schools. So we decided to use a k-means cluster to tier rank the schools.
Based on the data we had we determines that only a few metrics provided really tell us how well a school is preforming.
![Pic4](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/all_data_table.png)
The key metrics:
- % Grads
- % Total Regents of Cohort
- % Advanced Regents of Cohort
- % Dropout
![Pic3](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/Inital_input_features.png)
The rest of the columns were dropped.
To create our data clusters we need to reduce our key metrics using PCA. 
![Pic1](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/School_PCA.png)
Check our data loss, fortunately we are only reducing 4 columns of data to 3 so we do not much data is lost. 
![Pic5](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/Accurcay_score.png)
- Accuracy Score: 98.11%
Then we determine how many groups is best by using an Elbow Curve, which determined to be 3.
![Pic2](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/Elbow_curve.png)
Finally we will train our model using the sklearn library (KMeans).
![Pic6](https://github.com/es2681/student_analysis_project/blob/main/images/School_analysis_with_class.png)
Plot data, colors showing groups.

Expected Output features:
- Tier ranking the classes based on preformance.




## Technology
1. PostgreSQL to store the data.
2. Python-JupyterNotebook-Pandas to clean the data.
3. Git to manage all our code.
4. Tableau for initial data exploration.
5. Github Pages to store our Website.
6. JavaScript (Plotly) and HTML to display the charts.
7. Sklearn (KMeans) library for the Machine Learning part.

## NYC Public School Classification Dashboard 

[Link to Dashboard](https://amairanir.github.io/school_dashboard/)

Image 1

Image 1 shows the intial page of the dashboard which includes an interactive dropdown menu where the user can to see information on each school based on the year. They can also see a bar chart which shows the percent grads, percent total reents of cohort, percent advanced regents of cohort, and percent dropout which were the values used in the machine learning model. The user is also presented with four pie charts of demogrpahic information of the students for each school: ethnicities, gendere, economic advantage, and students with disabilities. 

Image 2

Image 2 shows how the dashboard changes when a different school or year is selected. Not only do the values of the bar chart and pie charts change, but the color of the bar chart changes depending on how it was classified from the unsupervised machine learning model.
